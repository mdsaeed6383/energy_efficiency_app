# energy_efficiency_app
Deployed ML app using PyCaret and Streamlit to predict heating energy demand based on building design parameters.

# 🏠 Energy Efficiency Prediction App

This Streamlit web app predicts the **Heating Load (Y1)** of a building based on architectural design features using an AutoML model built with **PyCaret**.

## 🔍 Features

- Trained on the Energy dataset
- Accepts 5+ user inputs (e.g., Compactness, Roof Area, Orientation)
- Uses PyCaret regression pipeline to predict Y1
- Clean UI built with Streamlit
